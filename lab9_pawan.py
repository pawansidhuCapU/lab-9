"""
Pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image. 
A digital image is a finite collection of pixels.

These pixels are organized in a two-dimensional grid. 
Each image (grid of pixels) has its own width and its own height. 
The width is the number of columns of pixels,
and the height is the number of rows of pixels.

In image processing, we access pixels in the grid by using column index and row index.
E.g, you can open the image_pixel_grid.png file in this folder (on the left).
The pixel of the pink one is found at column c and row r. 
And the pixel at the top left corner can be accessed as column 0 and row 0. 
Yes, we are always counting from 0 in computer science.

In color images, each pixel is represented by three values (r, g, b). 
The values indicate the intensity of red, green, and blue, respectively.

Before we start our lab, let's read some image processing examples below.

The size of red_one_pixel.png is much less than the size of red_more_pixels.png.

Exercise 5 - Decode an image (20 marks)

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video
within another file, message, image, or video. 

The file rick_encoded.png looks normal, 
but we actually hid a secret image inside the red channel.  

Implement the following algorithm:
 - Create a secret image with the same width and height as rick_encoded.png
 - Use our nested loop to process each pixel:
     - If the red channel is odd, turn the resulting pixel on the new image to black,
     i.e., (0, 0, 0)
     - Otherwise, if the red channel is even, turn the resulting pixel on the new image
     to red, i.e., (255, 0, 0)
